## Cognitive Tracking in Menopause: Clinical Relevance of Task-Switching

Women transitioning through menopause, particularly during the perimenopausal phase, often experience cognitive symptoms colloquially termed “brain fog,” which encompasses deficits in memory, verbal learning, and processing speed (Bangle et al., 2025). Like this, the study by Metcalf et al. (2023) have indicated that over 60% of perimenopausal women report symptoms related to memory and concentration. In addition, declines in cognitive domains such as working memory and attention have been observed, suggesting that the menopausal transition has detectable effects on higher-order cognitive processes. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies further support the notion that hormonal changes associated with menopause influence brain energy metabolism and synaptic function, thus contributing to the observed cognitive alterations (Bangle et al., 2025).

Task‐switching tests are designed to assess an individual’s ability to alternate attention between different tasks, a faculty that is central to executive function. These tests often involve rapid shifts in cognitive strategies to accommodate changing rules or stimuli, thereby measuring the dynamic interplay between attention, working memory, and mental flexibility (Gaál & Czigler, 2017). Task-switching often requires holding task rules in working memory while inhibiting the previous task set. The clinical relevance of these tests is underscored by their sensitivity to even subtle changes in cognitive performance, which might not be detected by more general neuropsychological assessments (Maki & Weber, 2021). Current research indicates that specific cognitive domains—such as verbal memory, processing speed, and executive tasks—are especially vulnerable during the menopausal transition (Bangle et al., 2025b; Bangle et al., 2025c).

One of the primary challenges in clinical practice is distinguishing cognitive deficits caused by menopausal hormonal fluctuations from those resulting from normal aging or early neurodegenerative pathology. Task‐switching tests have proven effective in this differentiation owing to their focus on executive processes; these tests enable clinicians to detect changes in processing speed, cognitive flexibility, and verbal fluency that are specifically associated with hormonal transitions rather than pathological states (Devi, 2018). Given that menopausal symptoms such as memory loss can mimic early signs of conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, the objective measurements provided by task‐switching tests are invaluable in avoiding misdiagnosis (Ryan et al., 2014).

The task-switching paradigm imposes a multi-demand cognitive load, thereby taxing both the shifting and updating components of executive function. Studies have shown that declines in task-switching performance are observed even when traditional memory or attention tests show minimal changes, highlighting its sensitivity as a diagnostic marker (Bangle et al., 2025d; Metcalf et al., 2023). This sensitivity is particularly important in the early stages of perimenopause and in cases of premature menopause, wherein hormonal changes may precipitate subtle yet clinically significant declines in cognitive performance (Ryan et al., 2014). Moreover, task‐switching tests are well-suited for such longitudinal applications because performance indices can be quantified over time to observe gradual declines or improvements, and may correlate with fluctuations in hormone levels or other physiological changes (Greendale et al., 2011). This dynamic monitoring is essential for early detection and timely intervention, potentially mitigating longer-term neurological decline.

Several studies have directly linked the hormonal fluctuations typical of perimenopause with declines in cognitive domains assessed by task-switching tests. For example, research on the impact of estrogen and its withdrawal on cognitive performance has underscored that abrupt changes in estrogen levels can precipitate declines in working memory and verbal fluency (Greendale et al., 2011). Moreover, the timing of estrogen supplementation appears to be critical; early intervention has been shown to mitigate some of the cognitive declines induced by cholinergic challenges, an effect that is best observable through tasks assessing executive functioning such as task-switching tests  (Bangle et al., 2025). These hormonal influences highlight the importance of using tests that are sensitive enough to capture the transient but clinically significant deficits that may occur during the menopausal transition.

The integration of task‐switching cognitive tests into routine diagnostic protocols for women undergoing menopausal transition has significant clinical implications. Because cognitive deficits in perimenopause are often subtle and may only emerge under conditions requiring rapid cognitive re-organization, task-switching tests provide a critical window into early executive dysfunction  (Devi, 2018). Including these tests in standard assessment batteries can aid in the early differentiation of menopause-related cognitive decline from other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, which may present with similar cognitive profiles (Metcalf et al., 2023). Early detection is paramount in implementing timely interventions, which may include hormonal replacement therapy, lifestyle modifications, or cognitive rehabilitation strategies.

Beyond early detection, task‐switching tests provide insights into the heterogeneity of cognitive deficits observed in menopausal women. Research suggests that while some women predominantly experience declines in verbal memory and processing speed, others may show more pronounced deficits in executive control and cognitive flexibility (Greendale et al., 2010). These differences underline the necessity for personalized diagnostic protocols. Task-switching assessments are uniquely positioned to identify cognitive subtypes associated with varying hormonal profiles, thereby facilitating more individualized care (Ryan et al., 2014).

Overall, the integration of task‐switching cognitive tests into clinical practice represents a significant step forward in addressing the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by menopause-related cognitive decline. Their inclusion not only bridges the gap between subjective cognitive complaints and objective performance deficits but also sets the stage for future developments in precision medicine approaches, which can further refine the management of menopausal symptoms and their neurological consequences.
